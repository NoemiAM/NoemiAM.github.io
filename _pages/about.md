Hi I'm Noemi! I'm currently a postdoc fellow at the [Max-Planck Institute for Astrophysics](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de). Previously, I did a PhD at the [Gravitation and Astroparticle Physics Amsterdam (GRAPPA) Institute](https://www.grappa.amsterdam), affiliated with the [Department of Physics at the University of Amsterdam](https://iop.uva.nl). I enjoy doing research at the intersection of astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics using modern statistics and machine learning techniques in order to improve our understanding of the dark Universe.

**Research Interests:**
Complex astrophysical and cosmological datasets at various observable scales have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the Universe and lead the way for new physics searches. My work uses probabilistic machine learning -- in particular simulation-based inference, generative modeling, and statistics -- to alleviate the challenges facing the fields of astrophysics and cosmology in light of the fload of high-quality data from current and future observatories. 
<!-- Specifically, I have mainly been developing techniques to analyze dark matter substructures in strong gravitational lensing systems ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09126), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09918), [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04365)). Moreover, I've recently got interested in point source analyses in sky-maps ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04291)). I also enjoy working on use-inspired method development, in particular for sequential simulation-based inference ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08597)). -->
